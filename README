This is a re-make of the classic game 'Tetris' in c++ using curses.

Points can be scored by creating complete lines. Uses the original NES Tetris' scoring system.
The level will increase for every 5 lines cleared, which will increase how fast the tetrominoes fall.

Controls:
    A: Move tetromino left
    D: Move tetromino right
    S: Speed up descent of the tetromino
    Q: Rotate the tetromino counter-clockwise
    E: Rotate the tetromino clockwise
    W: Hold the current tetromino; if one is held, swap them
    F: Quit
